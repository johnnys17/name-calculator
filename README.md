# Simple Name Length Calculator

## Overview
The Simple Name Length Calculator is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that processes a person's name to calculate and display fun facts about its length. It demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts, including data types, arithmetic operations, string methods, and the `Math` object. This project was created as part of my journey to become a full-stack engineer, following Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer course.

## Features
- Stores a name as a string and calculates its length.
- Performs arithmetic operations (e.g., doubling, halving, and finding the remainder) on the name's length.
- Checks if the name is short using a boolean.
- Uses `null` and `undefined` to represent invalid names.
- Rounds calculations with the `Math` object.
- Displays results using `console.log()` with string concatenation and methods like `toUpperCase()`.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core language for calculations and output.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment to execute the program.
